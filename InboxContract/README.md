# InboxContract Project

This is my first Ethereum Smart Contract and is a super basic project just to get started with Ethereum. This project is a part of the Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide course on Udemy that I had purchased a few years back but never finished! This time I want to finish it!

## About this Project
The Inbox Contract is one of the simplest Smart Contracts possible in Ethereum. It is basically a demo to show alteration of a state variable named message in the contract using a function called setMessage. It also involves a constructor that sets a default message. 

## From this project, I learned how to:
- Install all the necessary dependencies and setting up your local test environment
- Set up Metamask and became familiar with the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
- Wrote my First Smart Contract in Solidity
- Wrote Tests with Mocha & ran them
- How to get Rinkeby Test Ether (0.001ETH) from [this Faucet](http://rinkeby-faucet.com/)
- Use the Infura Ethereum API to deploy contracts to the Rinkeby Test Network
- Deploying the contract to the Rinkeby Network and viewing it on EtherScan
- Using Remix to Interact with the deployed Contract using its address
